# Stardust Framework

The Stardust Framework is a simple scene-based C++ game framework that uses SDL.

Compiles with Visual Studio 2017 using C++17 and SDL 2.0.8.

## Information

I made this framework as a proof-of-concept and practise. I have no plans to make documentation, but will if anyone wants it.

The framework is scene-based. I plan to make any future frameworks object-based instead.

It uses SDL's inbuilt renderer, but I plan to replace it with OpenGL - enabling 3D graphics.
